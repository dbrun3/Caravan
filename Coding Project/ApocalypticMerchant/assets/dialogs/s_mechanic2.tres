"comment": "Backstory: Before the apocalypse, Jackson was an engineer who worked in a manufacturing plant. When society collapsed, he turned his skills toward salvaging and repairing machinery to survive. Jackson is always tinkering with gadgets and vehicles, trying to keep them running in the wasteland.
Motivation: Jackson trades for spare parts, tools, and technical knowledge. He's especially interested in acquiring rare or unusual components that he can use to repair or upgrade his machines.",
