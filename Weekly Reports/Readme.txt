This directory should contain the weekly activity and progress reports for this group.

It is initially populated with "CS 442 Weekly Report for Week N.docx".
The group should first edit this file to replace "X" with the group number, 
and add all the group members' names.  Replace "Member 1", etc. with names.
Then copy the file each week, changing the "N" in the file name to 3, 4, 5, etc.
Edit the copies week by week to document the teams' weekly IN PERSON review meeting,
and the recent progress and current action items ( planned activities ) for each member.
